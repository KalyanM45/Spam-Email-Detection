Welcome to the Spam Email Detection README file!

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam. The project is implemented in Python.

**Dataset:**

We use the publicly available Email-Spam dataset, which is collected from the Kaggle. The dataset includes a total of 5,572 emails having 2 Variables i.e. Category - Spam/Ham,
Message.

**Approach:**

We use a supervised learning approach to train our model, using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and traditional machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we use the following steps:

Preprocessing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: We clean and tokenize the emails to convert them into a format that can be used by our machine learning algorithms.

Feature Extraction&nbsp;: We extract relevant features from the emails using NLP techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

Model Selection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: We train and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest and also a stacking model.

Model Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;: We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
